# Nairobi-transport-demand-Predication Using Regression Model
This project is the second capstone project we've done in our Almabetter Data science curriculam. All the models we have implemented in this project will be heavily based on regression since we have to predict a continuous dependent variable, which is 'Tickets' booking prediction in Nairobi.

Following algorithms have been used for predictions:-

* Linear Regression 
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Elastic Net Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest Regression
* XGB Regression




*Optimization*
* Random Forest with GridSearchCV
* XGBRegressor with Grid Search CV
